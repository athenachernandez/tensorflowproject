# TensorFlow Project ðŸ§±
- I used a Lego bricks dataset from Kaggle that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joosthazelzet/lego-brick-images?select=LEGO+brick+images+v1)
    - There are 16 classes and a total of 400 photos in each, meaning there are a total of 6400 images
    - This is realtively small dataset because I didn't want to overload my GPU and CPU with too much
## Features ðŸ”¦
- Avg stats; why X epochs; time per epoch
### CNN Calculations ðŸ”¢
- Image sizes were all square (200x200x3) and every class had the same amount of images (thanks to Joost Hazelzet, the creator of the dataset)
- Chose to grayscale images to quicken run time because they were gray, but still in RGB format
- Chose to use more Conv2D and MaxPool less than in example code because it helped improve my CNN's accuracy
- Dropout
### Live Feed ðŸ“¹
- Grayscaled input
- Didn't implement a background/none class, so that is my next step to improvement
  - Would try to classify non-Lego objects as Legos (including myself) instead of saying background/none
- Worked better after implemented data augmentation, but still pretty bad
### Data Augmentation ðŸŽž
- Doubled images
